# bitburner_scipts

My [BitBurner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/) scripts. This started as a manually copy / pasted grabbag but has since moved to using the excellent [VSCode plugin](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-vscode) so things are a little bit more orderly here.

Note I don't claim to be a Javascript programmer so this is probably a mess. In fact, I'm not sure how you got here to begin with?

## Gotchas

- await doesn't work in forEach !? (https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/issues/1961#issuecomment-997301344)
