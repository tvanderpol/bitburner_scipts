# bitburner_scipts

My [BitBurner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/) scripts. This is a loose collection of scripts I use in the game. There's no guarantee they're any good, but I was starting to feel bad these weren't in source control!

It's a bit of a manual process to get these scripts out of the game and into this repo so there's not going to be a particularly clean commit history.
